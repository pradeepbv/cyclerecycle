CycleReCycle
===========

The aim of this project is to recycle cyles that are unused, broken, abandoned and bring them back on road.

The project borrows ideas from http://www.recycledcycles.com/, http://www.kiva.org/ and http://thebicycleproject.blogspot.com/ 

The idea is to build a platform where people can contribute time, money, effort, equipment, information so that other people can benifit from it. The project will be run on a not-for-profit basis.
